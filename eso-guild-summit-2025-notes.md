## Introduction

These notes were taken from the 2025 ESO Guild Summit held in Discord on March 13, 2025. The summit focused on guild systems, improvements, and future plans for Elder Scrolls Online.

## Rich Lambert's Overview

Rich Lambert started by emphasizing that guilds are **incredibly important** across the board. They create social ties and improve player loyalty to the game.

### October Guild Feedback Survey Results

- **Membership patterns:** 90% of respondents were in multiple guilds with over 100 players. ZOS was surprised by the number of players in large guilds.
- **Primary motivation:** Shared interests were the #1 reason people join guilds.
- **Requested improvements:** Guild Communication Tools and Guild Management Tools were the most requested improvements.

Rich noted that guilds should serve more purposes than just commerce. Currently, the only mechanical benefit guilds provide is access to trading, which he initially called "the only super-valuable thing" before correcting himself.

### Future Planning

_"What are we thinking of doing? We are in planning stages for a lot of stuff."_ (Though no specific promises were made)

#### Under Consideration

- **Guild Management:** Better tools to run guilds, improved Guild Finder, enhanced Guild Searches, and better communication systems to inform guild members of activities.
- **Event Tools:** Systems to facilitate guild events such as raffles and scavenger hunts.
- **Pain Points:** Addressing issues with Guild Banks (permissions) and player notes (which currently anyone can edit).
- **Guild Halls:** A highly requested feature, though challenging due to server performance issues. Rich noted they likely won't ever allow 500 people in a single house.
- **Guild Progression:** Guild Achievements and a system for leveling up guilds.

Rich concluded this section by acknowledging: _"We can do better."_

## Q&A Session: Pre-selected Questions

These questions were selected based on upvotes from the community.

### Q: What is being planned for trading guilds since changes to economy?

**A:** "We have been making players' lives easier in general, which has had some knock-on effects on the economy. While there isn't anything specific right now, there are a lot of things we're working towards with guild traders in general (that should be a hint). The 30-day listings were changed for very specific performance reasons. I didn't really answer the question but we're working on it."

### Q: What about achievements tied to guild activities?

**A:** "Yes. We think guild progression is super awesome and gives people more mechanical reasons to be in the guild."

### Q: What about 500 Guild Limits / Guild Bank Limits / Listing Limits?

**A:** "These limits exist for performance reasons. A good example is player mail - many players were upset when we started enforcing expirations. We did this because some players had over FIFTY THOUSAND mails stored. Upon enforcement, storage requirements went from terabytes to gigabytes.

For Guild Listings, changing to 14 days significantly reduced load/storage. We made these changes based on guild trader data showing that 85-90% of sales happened within 2 days, and most items older than 10 days didn't sell at all.

Regarding Guild Limits: there are only a handful of games that allow membership in more than one guild. If you're in 5 guilds with 500 people each, that's 2500 connections we have to manage, which is really expensive.

For Guild History: There were addons that were actively sabotaging guild performance. That's why these limits are in place."

### Q: Why the 5 Guild limit?

**A:** "It was a number that Paul Sage (Rich's predecessor) liked because it was an easy number to do math with. Engineers did not like it being more than one."

### Q: Guild Tabards, ability to hide?

**A:** "We get this request a lot. The short answer is that the tabard functionality works as a switch." _(He implied this is critical to how the system works and would be hard to change, but they'd like to address it eventually. Not a high priority.)_

### Q: Capes?

**A:** "We had them in beta, they were terrible so we killed them."

### Q: Uncertainty about when to expect releases/lack of transparency (with removal of chapters)

**A:** "Pay attention to the Global Reveal in April, which will shed more info on our plans. We are in the position we're in today because we update quarterly, and I don't see that changing. We want to spread content out over the year instead of having one big release every June. Our motto is: 'Release it when it's ready'."

### Q: Guild Housing - would like to be able to manage houses as a guild instead of having just 1 owner

**A:** "We can absolutely dig into this, but no promises. The weirdness starts to come in over legalities of who owns the house."

### Q: Search Guild Finder by Guild Name?

**A:** "We can look into this. It's doable!"

### Q: Guild-Wide Mail system?

**A:** "It's on the list. It might not be 'mail' specifically, but we want to improve messaging to guild members."

### Q: How can GMs/officers help ZOS create/improve the game?

**A:** "Great question. My recommendation is to leverage the community team. You have access to them. Send them your notes, they're good at collating and sending for review. Finding a place for that to live is probably a good idea.

Send us docs! I'm happy to read docs or notebook files - just put it in a thoughtful format calling out the pain points/issues you are facing. Focus less on solutions, more on just the problems themselves.

Contact methods:

- Email: <community@zenimaxonline.com>
- PM via forums, Discord, etc."

## Q&A Session: Audience Questions

These questions came from audience members who raised their hands to speak.

### Q: Is it possible to set up [something API-related] for developers?

**A:** "Maybe? Not sure what is possible without overwhelming our servers."

### Q: Ping issues for Indonesia?

**A:** "The best way to explain our server situation is to understand how we build them. They're not the traditional MMO server system where everything is in a specific pod. It's not an isolated small thing - we have giant servers and giant pools of resources.

If we open servers in new regions, we need to make sure the community will support that. For example, Xbox EU is a low population server, as most EU players are on PC. That's something we have to balance.

It's not ideal, but in 2007 and 2011 when ZOS was developing the game, megaservers seemed like a good idea. We implemented them before cloud computing was widespread, and now we're somewhat locked into that approach."

### Q: End-game leaderboards are a mess - only showing top 100 scores but only 9 runs total (9 runs Ã— 12 players = 96). Score isn't intuitive - could we have leaderboards by runs, vitality, time, hard-mode?

**A:** "Good question. We debated extensively when creating leaderboards: What's useful at a glance? What information should it convey? We settled on score being most important because it factors in time, deaths, whether hard-mode was used, etc.

We don't do a particularly good job of helping people understand that. Regarding the wonkiness, some aspects are by design, while others are just issues that need fixing. Those fixes are on our list."

### Q: Since we don't know anything about the next trial, can we assume it won't be in the June release?

**A:** "Pay close attention to the April 10 Global Reveal."

### Q: The 5 Guild Limit is really difficult. It means we're constantly having to drop guilds. Could you consider a 10 guild limit and address the "500 connections" issue?

**A:** "It's a very challenging problem. The limits exist because of this complexity. We might consider lowering the guild member limit to allow more guilds, but that introduces new problems - how do you reduce a 500-member guild to 300 members?"

### Q: Console addons - What types will be viable given technical limitations?

**A:** "Good question, but difficult to answer. In general, consoles have strict memory limits. PC players typically have 16, 32, or 64GB of RAM, which allows for some impressive addons that write to your hard drive.

Addon authors will need to consider memory usage and stay within console limitations. Some likely candidates for porting include Lazy Writ Crafter, map-related addons, and Code's combat alerts. Beyond those, it depends on each addon author's willingness to optimize their work."

### Q: I really like when you include players in the lore, but these opportunities are locked behind rare contests. I wish there were more ways to integrate our characters into the story

**A:** "It's possible. We try to be careful because of IP-related concerns - we're protective of the Elder Scrolls intellectual property."

### Q: What steps are you taking to ensure new guild features/mechanics will be tested by a variety of players?

**A:** "I don't entirely agree with the implied criticism. At launch, we didn't know exactly what type of game we wanted to make. We tried to balance between being an MMO and an Elder Scrolls game. Once we chose to prioritize Elder Scrolls first and MMO second, that solved many problems and changed our approach.

Going forward, that's why we're conducting surveys, holding this guild summit, and seeking feedback - to identify pain points. Everyone plays the game differently, and we need to understand that diversity."

### Q: For guilds focused on helping new players, it would be much easier if we could check what content people have completed. A companion app would help access this info outside the game. Would you consider making these tools or allowing programmers access?

**A:** "I agree 100% - that would be cool. We'd need to implement it in a way that doesn't impact the servers. I probably shouldn't say this, but we've explored companion apps in the past. They've always failed because they would 'blow up the server.'"

### Q: You mentioned that trading is the main mechanical benefit guilds offer. Are there plans to expand this? Do you know what percentage of players don't interact with guilds at all?

**A:** "Yes, we know how many players are or aren't in guilds. It's a surprisingly small number that aren't in guilds. The vast majority play ESO like a traditional Elder Scrolls game but are also guild members.

Players don't necessarily know about all the features in-game, and we need to improve that. How do we showcase all these cool systems we've added over 10 years? We have more plans for addressing this going forward."

### Q: What's your best advice for Guild Masters trying to bring new players into the game?

**A:** "Good question. I don't know that I have a definitive answer. From my personal experience, the biggest concerns new players have about ESO are:

1. It's 10 years old and they feel they can't catch up - which is a false assumption. With One Tamriel, you can play with everyone regardless of level.
2. 'I don't want to play with other people, I just want my Elder Scrolls game.'

I don't know how to overcome these misconceptions other than to keep explaining. The ESO community is incredibly welcoming - we don't have the toxic environment like 'The Barrens Chat' from other MMOs. The ESO community is genuinely great."

### Q: How do the story writers feel about RP in the game, and what are future plans?

**A:** "We love the RP community. It's really cool that players can take our stories and make them their own. Going forward, we're leaning more into that - the Prologue quest on PTS has more roleplay options.

We'll continue adding RP options as we move forward. It's a good way to change things up and tell stories differently. NPCs will react to you being a jerk, being flirty, etc. We also have new emotes and costumes planned."

### Q: Why is the guild bank limited to 500 slots? We thought when you separated guild history, we'd be able to purchase more slots

**A:** "It comes down to storage implications. We have to think about the worst-case scenario. If we gave every guild 500 more slots, that's a significant amount of additional data we'd be storing, which affects bank loading times and server performance. We're equally careful about player inventory for the same reasons."

### Q: You mentioned "Xbox EU is a low population server." Are there plans to integrate servers?

**A:** "Heard. There's not a lot I can say other than we are aware, we know the issue exists, and we have ideas."

> **Note:** At this point, Gina noted that dozens of questions would not be addressed due to time constraints. They may look into another way to answer the missed questions.

### Q: Regarding Guild Halls - could you adapt the existing housing system rather than creating something entirely new?

**A:** "We've thought a lot about Guild Halls. The core stumbling block is: how do we get 500 players into a zone all in one location? Your point about adapting existing systems is noted - we can look into that some more."

### Q: Thoughts about build hybridization? Many players dislike how builds are being funneled in one direction

**A:** "Understood. But why do you feel you have to run exactly what the meta dictates?"

> **Questioner:** "Because content creators showcase the best builds."

"You don't need 120k DPS to complete a trial. The meta constantly evolves. There are many viable builds that aren't necessarily 'the most optimal.' We've observed over the years that as soon as someone breaks a record, everyone rushes to copy their build.

That trend has decreased in recent years because we've focused on making things more consistent. Just because a content creator claims something is 'best,' is it actually mandatory? I would argue it's not. Also, pay attention to the Global Reveal in April."

### Q: What about increasing guild furnishing limits? Or accessing the Guild Bank from Guild Houses?

**A:** "It's a design philosophy. We don't want everything to be replicated in houses because that would remove reasons to visit towns and cities.

Regarding furnishing caps: it remains a performance issue - we don't want people to crash when entering homes. We've been working on ways to increase these limits but haven't been very successful so far. We're still working on it."

### Q: In Cyrodiil, when guilds capture resources or keeps, it doesn't seem very beneficial. Do you agree, and are there plans to improve this?

**A:** "We recognize this issue. For plans going forward, Brian Wheeler and team are focusing on performance improvements and the upcoming Big Champions test. If it works out (both performance-wise and in player reception), we'll implement it. If not, we'll reassess.

We hope solving these fundamental issues will open the door to implementing other improvements in Cyrodiil."

### Q: Can you assure us the game will still be around in 5 years?

**A:** "The best way to answer that question is to ask: Would we be doing something as 'batshit' as Cyrodiil Champions if we were just going to mothball the game and put it on life support? We wouldn't commit to something so ambitious if we planned to let the game die. We are committed to ESO and doing everything we can to keep it thriving."

_(Rich then responded to a negative comment in text chat claiming the game is dead)_: "The game has been 'dead' for years." _(Rich clarified)_: "That was me being snarky."

### Q: Guild Heraldry improvements - updating tabard appearances, decorating houses with guild symbols, adding more colors/symbols, or allowing customization of symbols?

**A:** "So we can have a lot of phallic things?" _(laughs)_ "I generally lean toward creating new things rather than updating old ones. The controversy over Templar Jabs is a good example - we thought our changes were improvements, but the community disagreed."

## Personal Reflections

_Posted at 5:58 PM by Hiyde:_

Now that I've had time to digest, here are my takeaways:

- It was great to gather in Discord with a few hundred guild leaders and collaborate on our questions.
- Kudos to ZOS for taking the time to recognize the importance of guilds and acknowledge that the current tools are lacking.
- While we didn't get specifics on what improvements are coming or when (which I didn't expect), it's clear they're planning significant enhancements.
- This is a positive sign for ESO's future. To quote Rich, it would be "batshit" for them to hold this summit and plan features like the Cyrodiil test if the game were heading toward sunset.

I don't know what the future holds, but I think we'll all gain more insight with the big reveal next month. These are positive developments! ðŸ™‚
